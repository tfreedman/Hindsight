  # This is a blank file showing how to filter specific events from Hindsight. For example,
  # we might not be interested in all of the Nickserv messages we've ever sent/received, as
  # they're mostly noise. To filter them out, we move this file to user_filters.rb, and 
  # return nil if it matches. Invoke this in ApplicationController.
